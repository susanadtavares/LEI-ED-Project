# LEI-ED-Project

Repository for the Final Project of the Data Structures Curricular Unit

# 📚 **Higher Education Institution Library Management Platform**
This platform was developed to streamline and optimize the management of a university library, handling thousands of books organized across multiple thematic areas such as Programming, Design, and Mathematics. 

It supports efficient control of books, readers, and loan requests, ensuring accurate data handling through validation of text-file inputs, unique identifiers, and date formats.

The system includes functionalities for managing books and readers, processing loans and returns, and exporting information to XML. Built with modular C code, it relies on linked lists and hash tables to maintain performance and ensure data integrity. 

This repository contains all project files.
